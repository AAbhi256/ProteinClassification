# ProteinClassification
Utilizing multiple types of features for protein classification!

The point of this project was to utilize more than just sequence data for protein classification. Standard apporaches use reccurrent neural networks on protein sequences to predict protein classification, but we went about trying to see if we could use other easily attainable features to aid with prediction.
